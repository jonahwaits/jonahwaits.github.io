    "text": "Three years ago, the Nebraska Huskers baseball team traveled to Fayetteville, Arkansas and lost to the #1 Razorbacks in the Fayetteville regional.\nThis team was supposedly the best Huskers team since 2005 when Alex Gordon won the Golden Spikes Award; an annual award given to the best college baseball player in the nation.\nSo, for at least three years now, Nebraska Cornhuskers fans have screamed up and down that their 2021 Nebraska baseball team should have hosted a regional.\nLets find out if that’s true.\nHint: If you’re a Huskers fan, you might not like the answer.\nUsing the RPI (Rating Percentage Index) created by Jim Wright and the NCAA, and the Strength of Schedule (SOS) number from WarrenNolan.com, originally from the NCAA, will help get down to the bottom of it.\nBefore, we look at the complicated stuff, let’s look at something easy, run differential:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nbaseball &lt;- read_csv(\"baseball2021.csv\") |&gt; mutate(SOS = as.numeric(SOS)) |&gt; mutate(RPI = as.numeric(RPI)) \n\ntable &lt;- read_csv(\"baseballtable.csv\")\n\nrteam &lt;- c(\"Arkansas\", \"Mississippi State\", \"Vanderbilt\", \"South Carolina\", \"Ole Miss\", \"   \nLouisiana Tech\", \"Texas Christian\", \"Tennessee\", \"Stanford\", \"Arizona\", \"Texas\", \"Texas Tech\", \"Notre Dame\", \"Florida\", \"East Carolina\", \"Oregon\", \"Nebraska\", \"Louisiana Tech\")\n\nregionals &lt;- baseball |&gt; filter(regionals == \"yes\")\n\nnu &lt;- baseball |&gt;  filter(team == \"Nebraska\")\n\nregionalnu &lt;- baseball |&gt; filter(team %in% rteam)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=regionalnu, aes(x=reorder(team, diff), weight=diff), fill=\"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=nu, aes(x=reorder(team, diff), weight=diff), fill=\"#E41C38\") +  \n  theme_minimal() + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title=\"See, Look!

Let’s look at quad 1 wins.\nBut first, what are Quad 1 wins?\nTo answer that, we must first understand what RPI is.\nSo, imagine you have a big ol’ group of friends, and you want to know which friend is the best. You decide to make a list and put your friends in order from best to not so good friend.\nIn college baseball, the RPI is kind of like that list for teams. It helps people see how good a baseball team is compared to other teams. The RPI looks at a few things like how many games a team has won, who they’ve played against, and where they played.\nSo, if a team has a high RPI, it means they’re doing really well. But if their RPI is low, they might not be doing so great. It’s just a way to help figure out which teams are the strongest.\nQuad 1 teams are teams that sit in the Top 25 in RPI, hence, Quad 1 wins are wins against those Top 25 teams.\n\n\nCode\ntable |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(quad_1_wins)) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    conf_ranl = \"Conference Rank\",\n    quad_1_wins = \"Quad 1 Wins\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Regionals?

That means that all season long, Nebraska won just two games against teams that were considered great. Every team that received the privilege of hosting a regional in their city had at least seven. All of them proved at least seven times that they were great. Nebraska didn’t do that.\nNow, if some you classically delusional Huskers fans are still here and still holding out hope; don’t.\nNot only was Nebraska dead last in Strength of Schedule compared to all regional hosting teams, it was also dead last in RPI.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=baseball, aes(x=RPI, y=SOS), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=regionals, aes(x=RPI, y=SOS), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=nu, aes(x=RPI, y=SOS), color=\"#E41C38\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=nu, aes(x=RPI, y=SOS, label=team)) +\n  scale_x_reverse() +\n  scale_y_reverse() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Nebraska Still Dead Last Among Regional Hosting Teams\",\n    x = \"RPI Ranking\",\n    y= \"Strength of Schedule Ranking\", \n    caption= \"Source: WarrenNolan.com | By Jonah Waits\",\n    subtitle = \"All the teams that hosted a &lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;regional&lt;/span&gt; lay inside the tippy top right of the table. While &lt;span style = 'color:#E41C38;'&gt;Nebraska&lt;/span&gt; is up there, they are far far away from the regional hosting teams.\"\n  ) +\n   theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face =\"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does this prove?\nIt proves that Nebraska was better than most teams in the country. But it also proves that all the teams that hosted a regional had a better RPI ranking (They were better against harder teams) and had a better Strength of Schedule (they played harder teams).\nIn fact, all this chart proves is that there were some teams, not Nebraska, that were snubbed. Look at all that grey amongst all that blue.\nPut all these charts together, and what do you get. Proof that Nebraska was destined to go into Fayetteville, Arkansas and lose to the best team in the country, the Arkansas Razorbacks, in their regional.\nThe 2021 Nebraska baseball team was not snubbed, they were properly left out."
