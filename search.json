    "text": "Three years ago, the Nebraska Huskers baseball team traveled to Fayetteville, Arkansas and lost to the #1 Razorbacks in the Fayetteville regional.\nThis team was supposedly the best Huskers team since 2005 when Alex Gordon won the Golden Spikes Award; an annual award given to the best college baseball player in the nation.\nSo, for at least three years now, Nebraska Cornhuskers fans have screamed up and down that their 2021 Nebraska baseball team should have hosted a regional.\nLets find out if that’s true.\nHint: If you’re a Huskers fan, you might not like the answer.\nUsing the RPI (Rating Percentage Index) created by Jim Wright and the NCAA, and the Strength of Schedule (SOS) number from WarrenNolan.com, originally from the NCAA, will help get down to the bottom of it.\nBefore, we look at the complicated stuff, let’s look at something easy, run differential:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nbaseball &lt;- read_csv(\"baseball2021.csv\") |&gt; mutate(SOS = as.numeric(SOS)) |&gt; mutate(RPI = as.numeric(RPI)) \n\ntable &lt;- read_csv(\"baseballtable.csv\")\n\nrteam &lt;- c(\"Arkansas\", \"Mississippi State\", \"Vanderbilt\", \"South Carolina\", \"Ole Miss\", \"   \nLouisiana Tech\", \"Texas Christian\", \"Tennessee\", \"Stanford\", \"Arizona\", \"Texas\", \"Texas Tech\", \"Notre Dame\", \"Florida\", \"East Carolina\", \"Oregon\", \"Nebraska\", \"Louisiana Tech\")\n\nregionals &lt;- baseball |&gt; filter(regionals == \"yes\")\n\nnu &lt;- baseball |&gt;  filter(team == \"Nebraska\")\n\nregionalnu &lt;- baseball |&gt; filter(team %in% rteam)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=regionalnu, aes(x=reorder(team, diff), weight=diff), fill=\"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=nu, aes(x=reorder(team, diff), weight=diff), fill=\"#E41C38\") +  \n  theme_minimal() + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title=\"See, Look!

Let’s look at quad 1 wins.\nBut first, what are Quad 1 wins?\nTo answer that, we must first understand what RPI is.\nSo, imagine you have a big ol’ group of friends, and you want to know which friend is the best. You decide to make a list and put your friends in order from best to not so good friend.\nIn college baseball, the RPI is kind of like that list for teams. It helps people see how good a baseball team is compared to other teams. The RPI looks at a few things like how many games a team has won, who they’ve played against, and where they played.\nSo, if a team has a high RPI, it means they’re doing really well. But if their RPI is low, they might not be doing so great. It’s just a way to help figure out which teams are the strongest.\nQuad 1 teams are teams that sit in the Top 25 in RPI, hence, Quad 1 wins are wins against those Top 25 teams.\n\n\nCode\ntable |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(quad_1_wins)) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    conf_ranl = \"Conference Rank\",\n    quad_1_wins = \"Quad 1 Wins\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Regionals?

That means that all season long, Nebraska won just two games against teams that were considered great. Every team that received the privilege of hosting a regional in their city had at least seven. All of them proved at least seven times that they were great. Nebraska didn’t do that.\nNow, if some you classically delusional Huskers fans are still here and still holding out hope; don’t.\nNot only was Nebraska dead last in Strength of Schedule compared to all regional hosting teams, it was also dead last in RPI.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=baseball, aes(x=RPI, y=SOS), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=regionals, aes(x=RPI, y=SOS), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=nu, aes(x=RPI, y=SOS), color=\"#E41C38\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=nu, aes(x=RPI, y=SOS, label=team)) +\n  scale_x_reverse() +\n  scale_y_reverse() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Nebraska Still Dead Last Among Regional Hosting Teams\",\n    x = \"RPI Ranking\",\n    y= \"Strength of Schedule Ranking\", \n    caption= \"Source: WarrenNolan.com | By Jonah Waits\",\n    subtitle = \"All the teams that hosted a &lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;regional&lt;/span&gt; lay inside the tippy top right of the table.

But it also proves that all the teams that hosted a regional had a better RPI ranking (They were better against harder teams) and had a better Strength of Schedule (they played harder teams).\nIn fact, all this chart proves is that there were some teams, not Nebraska, that were snubbed. Look at all that grey amongst all that blue.\nPut all these charts together, and what do you get. Proof that Nebraska was destined to go into Fayetteville, Arkansas and lose to the best team in the country, the Arkansas Razorbacks, in their regional.\nThe 2021 Nebraska baseball team was not snubbed, they were properly left out."

    "section": "",
    "text": "On Monday, March 11 at approximately 11 a.m., the Green Bay Packers made one of the most surprising moves of the 2024 NFL offseason when it was announced by Ian Rapoport that they planned to sign 26-year-old Raiders star running back, Josh Jacobs.\nJacobs is coming off a 2023 season in which he averaged a career-low 3.5 yards per carry but is only a year removed from leading the NFL with 1,653 yards in 2022.\nFor the time being, the Packers had one of the best, if not the best, running back duos in the NFL pairing Jacobs along side Aaron Jones. It might have even been one the best pairings in NFL history, but it wasn’t meant to last.\nLess than four hours after the report came out, Green Bay informed Jones that he was being released. This came as a shock to many after Packers GM Brian Gutekunst had just told the media weeks earlier that he wanted to keep Jones.\nThe Packers and Jones’ agent, Drew Rosenhaus, had been in talks to reduce Jones’ 17.6million cap charge, a figure that included an 11.1 million base salary, good enough for 7th highest running back salary in the league. That, however, didn’t happen, and Jones was released.\nHe later signed with the Packers NFC North rivals, the Minnesota Vikings.\nThe question we must answer then is this: Were the Packers right to move on from Jones in favor of Jacobs?\nTo do this, we’ll look at statistics from only 2023. The running back position has one of the least longevities of any football position, so prior year stats are the most telling and the most trust worthy, baring any sort of large scale injury that causes the back to miss more than half of the season.\nIn 2023, Josh Jacobs performed better in almost every major category except rush yards per carry, which was over a full yard above Jacobs.\nJacobs performed better than Jones in fantasy all season long.\nNow you might be asking, why use fantasy football to prove a point? Simply: Fanatsy is actually maybe the best statistic to use. it incorporates all production on the field, whether that be recieving yards or rushing yards, maybe a fumble that decreases production. In essence fantasy points can tell us who had better on field production and the answer is Josh Jacobs.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(waffle)\n\nrushing23 &lt;- read_csv(\"runback23.csv\")\n\naj &lt;- rushing23 |&gt; filter(player == \"Aaron Jones (MIN)\")\n\njj &lt;- rushing23 |&gt; filter(player == \"Josh Jacobs (GB)\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=rushing23, aes(x=fpts_g, y=rost), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=aj, aes(x=fpts_g, y=rost), color=\"#4F2683\") +\n  geom_point(data=jj, aes(x=fpts_g, y=rost), color=\"#FFB612\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.938298, color=\"lightblue\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Josh Jacobs Is The Better Fantasy Player\",\n    x = \"Fantasy Points Per Game\",\n    y= \"Percent of Roster Player Was On\", \n    caption= \"Source: fantasypros.com | By Jonah Waits\",\n    subtitle = \"In 2023 &lt;span style = 'color:#FFB612;'&gt;Josh Jacobs&lt;/span&gt; performed better per game than &lt;span style = 'color:#4F2683;'&gt;Aaron Jones&lt;/span&gt; while also being the perfered fantasy back.\"\n  ) +\n   theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face =\"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only did Jacobs just have more production, he had more production in every category.

But, only two and that doesn’t explain the humongous gab that we see in usage. Maybe its that the Packers trusted their quarterback more than Las Vegas trusted theirs. Maybe Green Bay was in more passing situations. Maybe, just maybe, the Raiders trusted Jacobs more than the Packers trusted Jones.\nOne thing is clear, though, and should be so obvious. If you play more games, you’re probably going to produce more. Not to mention that Jacobs is three years younger than Jones and at the running back position, that’s a whole lifetime younger. A whole lifetime to be more productive.\nSo did the Packers make the right move?\nAll the signs point to yes, but only time will tell. They could get burned."
